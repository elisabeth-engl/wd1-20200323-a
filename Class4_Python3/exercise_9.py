# write a loop which randomly generates
# either a 1 or a 2
#
# store the amount of times a 1 was generated in
# the variable "heads" and the amount of times a 2
# was generated in the variable "tails"
#
# let the loop run 100 times.
# what percentage of the time did you get
# tails/heads?
#
# then let the loop run 10 000 times.
# what percentage did you get now?
#
# to generate random integers us the random library
# and the function random.randint(a,b)
#
# randint(a,b) -> Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b

# you can find more about the random library here:
